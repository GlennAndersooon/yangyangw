# Awesome Resources on Graph Neural Networks With Heterophily

This repository contains the relevant resources on graph neural network (GNN) with consideration of heterophily. 

It's worth noting that the **heterophily** we consider here is not the same as **heterogeneous**. Heterogeneous is more related to the node type difference such as the user and item nodes in recommender systems, but heterophily is more like the feature or label difference between the neighbors under the nodes with the same type. Traditional GNNs usually assume that similar nodes (features/classes) are connected together, but the "opposites attract" phenomenon also widely exists in general graphs.

This repository is a collection of the heterophily thinking papers and other resources, including corresponding papers, datasets, and codes (if applicable), etc.

If you find anything incorrect, please let me know. And welcome your contributions.
