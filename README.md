# Awesome Graph Neural Network Papers With Heterophily



This repository contains the graph neural network (GNN) papers with consideration of heterophily. 

It's worth noting that the heterophily we consider here is not the same as heterogeneous. Heterogeneous is more related to the node type difference such as the user and item node in recommender systems, but heterophily is more like the feature or label difference between the neighbors under the nodes with the same type. Traditional GNNs usually assume that similar nodes (features/classes) are connected together, but the "opposites attract" phenomenon also widely exists in general graphs.

This repository is a collection of the relevant heterophily thinking papers, including corresponding paper URLs, codes (if applicable), etc.

If you find anything incorrect, please let me know. And welcome your contributions.
